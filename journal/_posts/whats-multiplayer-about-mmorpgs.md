title: where's the "multiplayer" in mmorpgs?
published: false

Basically, popular mmorpgs are like a collection of different mini games, most of which are single player or 2-8 player. I want to explore how in a vaccum, these mini games seem to be less fun for players. I also want to look into why games that advertise true massively multiplayer gameplay, don't seem to do well. 

potential games of note
- ffxiv (housing, main story, 8man savage,)
- wow (arena vs bgs, collectibles gamers, 20man raids, mythic +)
- wow classic (vanilla 40 man, GDKP, scarab lord)
- ashes of creation / archeage
- crowfall
- maplestory/korean grind mmos
- guild wars 2 GvG -> de-emphasized
- planetside 2
