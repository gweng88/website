title: thoughts on designing mmorpg dailies
published: false
---

I want to think about why "dailies" are so prevalent in mmorpgs, the pros and cons for players, and the pros and cons for developers. As well as cataloguing the wide variety of approaches in games, including mobile "gacha" games. Lastly, I'm hoping to bring to the table some ideas on how to effectively design this kind of system in games, maybe a framework for making sure the system doesn't drift to an extremely undesirable state.

ideas
- login rewards
- daily battle pass missions
- daily/weekly content lockouts
- im too far behind and i cant catch up
- shit on game who have a producer who is optimizing for DAU at the expense of lots of player retention problems
- categorizing dailies that take 0 seconds to do, dailies that take 1 minute to do, dailies that take 15 minutes to do, dailies that take 1 hour to do
- building player profiles, what happens when players feel like they must do EVERY daily, and you also have 11 systems in the game that all have a 1 hour daily (hint: your player is playing 11 hours of dailies)
- "time gating me to eat up my sub time" is a legit idea for producer, but feels bad man
- DAU is nice and all, but it's still not exactly where the money comes from (see path of exile retention?)
- valorant daily rotating shop -> the greatest idea in daily engagement??
- how much "power" should be in dailies? (maplestory)
-- powerful dailies -> equalize play difference, ie. grinding outside of daily is very diminishing, easy for players to relax and stay relevant
